# Python Boot
A repository intended to help starters to understand the basics of Python.

## What can I use Python for?
- We can use Python in Windows, Linux, and Mac OS
- It can be used to build:
  - Scripts
  - Console applications
  - Desktop applications
  - Web back-ends
  - Scientific computations
  - Home Automation
  - Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence apps
- Use-cases?
  - Cross-platform desktop application which has the same look in same OS
  - Automate something, say parsing a CSV file? - Use Python scripts
  - App which recognizes pictures and categorize them? Use Python with TensorFlow library

## Python 2 vs. Python 3
- Python 3 is not backward compatible with version 2. However, both can co-exist on the same machine (python --version && python3 --version).
- Python 2 is given extended [EOL (end-of-life) by 2020](https://pythonclock.org).

## Installing Python and IDE
- Installation can be done on Mac OS, PC, and Linux machines
- Python installation installs the Python Interpreter and it also comes with standard IDLE - a Python IDE
- Check the installation by checking the version in any CLI `python --version`
- We can also install a free Python IDE - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
